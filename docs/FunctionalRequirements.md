# General Description

The objective of the project is to create a realistic simulation of the school life in B3, a building that is currently being built for AlgoSup. The project will need to be realised in VR (Virtual Reality). 
The project is given by Algosup and monitored by Sebastien Goisbeault, VR and XR consultant.

# Target audience
We target potential future students as well as their parents. 
This project could also be useful for current students and potential investors to help them visualise the future look of AlgoSup.
Finally, the school Staff could use the simulation to see if they like the way the B3 is arranged and predict possible complications in advance.


# In-simulation mechanics

## Menus
<sup>* Menus must be interactive <sup>
<!-- Came back here to specify how menus are accesed, how it should look etc.. -->

- Main menu:
	- Start button
	- Settings button
	- Quit button


- Settings menu:
	- Height controls:
		- Set user height
	- Movement controls:
		- Snap turn / Smooth turn / No-mode
		- Teleportation / locomotion
	- Sound controls:
		- Slider
	- NPC limit (if multiplatform):
		- The ability to set a npc limit for weaker computers
	- Respawn access:
		- A security respawn button
    - Stop scenario:
        - A button that stops the current scenario (must be inactive if user is not mid-scenario)
	- Back to main menu button:
		- A link back to the main menu


- Map:
	- The user must be able to access the map at all times.
	- The user must be able to see their position on the map.
	- There must be a list of available scenarios and other similar points of interest (ex: character selection).
	- There must be a legend detailing the significations of the pins on the map.

## Playable characters

The user must be able to play the simulation out from the perspective of different characters.
These characters must be able to have different interractions and must be able to access different parts of the building.

The user must be capable of choosing their prefeered character at the reception.
The reception must have a clear and highly visible indicator that marks it as the place to change character at.
The map must have a pin that clearly indicates the location of the reception.
The user must not be able to change his character mid-scenario.

### Planned characters:

- Male / Female student:
  - Young looking characters, preferably with a similar nut distinguishable model to that of the other student npc's
  - The student characters must have access to the following rooms:
    - Common rooms (ex: the relaxation room(s))
    - The classrooms
    - Their and only their project room
    - Their respective toilettes

- Orator ("intervenant" in french):
  - A bit older looking character
  - The orator can access to the following rooms:
    - Common rooms (ex: the relaxation room(s))
    - The classrooms
    - Any project room
    - Their respective toilettes
    - Teacher specific rooms (ex: Reunion rooms)
  
- Franck:
  - A very Franck looking character
  - Has access to every part of the school

## Predefined scenarios

The simulation must contain a list of predefined scenarios.
These scenarios must stay fairly simplistic.
