# General Description

The objective of the project is to create a realistic simulation of the school life in B3, a building that is currently being built for AlgoSup. The project will need to be realised in VR (Virtual Reality). 
The project is given by Algosup and monitored by Sebastien Goisbeault, VR and XR consultant.

# Target audience
We target potential future students as well as their parents. 
This project could also be useful for current students and potential investors to help them visualise the future look of AlgoSup.
Finally, the school Staff could use the simulation to see if they like the way the B3 is arranged and predict possible complications in advance.
