# General description

The objective of the simulation is to highlight possible problems that may arise within ALGOSUPs new shoolbuilding, the B3[^4].

The simulation must take place within the new school building, must contain characters (controlled by simple AI) to simulate students, speakers, teachers and administrative staff.
It also needs to be able to launch various scenarios which could highlight the more foreseeable problems that may appear in the future.

The non-user characters[^2] must follow a pre-planned schedule ensuring the day-to-day functionality of the building. These schedules must be only interrupted when the user launches a scenario, in which case they should start to act according to it.

The project must be realized in Virtual Reality[^1].

If successful, this project should be able to ensure the school building is built without any obvious faults.

This project has been proposed by ALGOSUP's[^3] leadership.

# Target audience
Our main target is  potential future students as well as their parents. However, this project could also be useful for current students and potential investors to help them visualise the future look of ALGOSUP[^3]. It could also be used to highlight the problems that we could encounter in the daily life in the building. Finally, the school Staff could use the simulation to see if they like the way the B3[^4] is arranged and predict possible complications in advance.

# The school building
While the 3D model of the building is provided at the start of the project, it needs to be seriously reworked before it could be considered usable for the simulation.

Most of the building is currently unoptimized for virtual reality[^1] and the inner textures of the building are purposefully missing.

The building also needs to be decorated.

The building must be fitted with signs and a map somewhere that is easy to spot.

The top floor of the building is not part of the school and therefore it can be ignored, however the elevator must still be made functional.

## Menus

## Definitions

[^1] VR: Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world.

[^2] NPC(Non player character): A non-player character (NPC) is any character in a game or simulation that is not controlled by a player/user.

[^3] ALGOSUP: Computer science school from France (The B3 will be the main building of the school)

[^4] B3 : The school building the simulation must take place in. A 3D model of the building is provided at the start of the projectA
