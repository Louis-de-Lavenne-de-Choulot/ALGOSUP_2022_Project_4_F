Thank you so much for downloading the Brick Project Apartment Kit.

The Build Kit is made based off a grid system X, Z, Y  Walls & Floors of 2.5 X 2.5 X 4, you can use Unityâ€™s progrids in assisted building.

The Interior walls sit on top of the interor floors in order to have a nice seamless fit.

I am looking to build the tools for the developers to create a whole cities.  I would love to feature your scenes on my website.  

Send me screen shots on your creations to sojaexiles@support.com with your unity user name so I can give proper credit.

This package has working doors, cabinet doors and windows.  So click away while you browse.  When you use a new prefab with a working script, 
you need to link the player to the script ot make the doors and windows work, this tells the script what can open the doors and windows.  

I have included a PDF document called Prefab Doors so you can see how to link it.

Please rate the package, it really helps support my direction on creating new content and better content, 
and if you have any ideas on my next package or how to improve this package, please send me an email.

Thanks!
